# Neopets Un-dyed

This project was created for a school project. It is not for public use.

### About App
Neopets Un-dyed is created for the users of the neocash community on Neopets to submit their unofficial dyeworks they have made instead of having them posted on individual pet pages.

This site also allows users to vote for items they would want to be dyed for the next season.
(Currently voting is done manually every season on the neoboards).
